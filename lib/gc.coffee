# ## Garbage Collection Module
#
# HashLife uses extensive [canonicalization][canonical] to optimize the storage of very large patterns with repetitive
# components. The Canonicalization Module implementss a very naive hash-table for canoncial representations of squares.

# ### Canoncialization: The "Hash" in HashLife
#
# Cafe au Life can calculate the future of many highly repetitive patterns without garbage collection, it simply
# caches all of its results as it goes along. That's blisteringly fast. However, patterns with a lot of entropy
# can quickly fill up the cache. On my development machine, Node blows up some time after the cache hits 700,000
# squares.
#
# By way of comparison, Cafe au Life can calulate the future of a glider gun out to [quadrillions of generations][b]
# with a population of 23,900,000,000,000,036 live cells,
# but the rabbits [methuselah][m] blows the cache up before it can stabilize with a population of 1,744 live cells
# at 17,331 generations.

#
# The size of the pattern and the length of the simulation are not the limiting factor, it's the entropy that counts.
# Or if you prefer, the time complexity. To handle patterns like 'rabbits,' we need to garbage collect the cache when
# it gets too big.
#
# This module implements a simple reference-counting scheme and cache garbage collector. It provides a `mixInto` function\
# so that it retroactively modify existing classes.

# ### Baseline Setup
_ = require('underscore')
{YouAreDaChef} = require('YouAreDaChef')
exports ?= window or this

exports.mixInto = ({Square, Cell}) ->

  # ### Reference Counting
  #
  # The basic principle is that a square's reference count is the number of squares in the cache that
  # refer to the square. So when we add a square to the cache, we increment the reference count for its children.
  # When we remove a square from the cache, we decrement the reference count for its children.
  #
  # There is a little bookkeeping involved with squares that memoize results, because we must increment their new children
  # on the fly. And we never garbage collect cells, level 1, or level 2 squares (the smallest and seed squares respectively).

  # ### NaÃ¯ve Garbage Collection
  #
  # Our GC is pretty bone-headed, it uses brute force to get a list of
  # removeable squares, then marches through them from highest to lowest
  # level, recursively removing them and any children freed up by removing them.
  _.extend Square.cache,

      _.map @buckets, (bucket) ->

    # ### Pinning squares
    #
    # So far, so good. But there is a flaw of sorts. When do we garbage collect?
    # And when we do garbage collect, what happens to intermediate results we're
    # using in the middle of calculating the future of a pattern?
    #
    # What we do is rewrite `Square.RecursivelyComputable.sequence` such that it
    # increments the references of squares passed in as a `parameter_hash`, and
    # decrements them when it's finished. This works recursively, so if at any time in
    # the middle of a computation we need to garbage collect, we can do it with
    # the confidence that we won't remove anything we're using.
    #
    # This means some care must be taken in the way `result` and `result_at_time(t)`
    # are written, such as always using `sequence` and a `parameter_hash`.
