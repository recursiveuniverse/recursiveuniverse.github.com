#
# ## Future Module
#
# The Future Module provides methods for computing the future of a pattern, taking into account its ability to grow beyond
# the size of its container square.

# ### The Life "Universe"
#
# This module mixes special case functionality for computing the `future` of a square into `Square` and `Cell`.

# ### Baseline Setup
_ = require('underscore')
exports ?= window or this

# ### Setting the rules for this game's "Universe"
#
# There many possible games consisting of cellular automata arranged in a two-dimensional
# matrix. Cafe au Life handles the "[life-like][ll]" ones, roughly those that have:
#
# [ll]: http://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Cellular_automaton#Well-known_Life-like_cellular_automata
#
# * A stable 'quiescent' state. A universe full of empty cells will stay empty.
# * Rules based only on the population of a cell's Moore Neighborhood: Every cell is affected by the population of its eight neighbours,
#   and all eight neighbours are treated identically.
# * Two states.
#
# Given a definition of the state machine for each cell, Cafe au Life performs all the necessary initialization to compute
# the future of a pattern.
#
# The default, `set_universe_rules()`, is equivalent to `set_universe_rules([2,3],[3])`, which
# invokes Conway's Game of Life, commonly written as 23/3. Other games can be invoked with their survival
# and birth counts, e.g. `set_universe_rules([1,3,5,7], [1,3,5,7])` invokes [Replicator][replicator]
#

  # ### Recap: Squares
  #
  # ![Block laying seed](block_laying_seed.png)
  #
  # *(A small pattern that creates a block-laying switch engine, a "puffer train" that grows forever.)*
  #
  # HashLife operates on square regions of the board, with the length of the side of each square being a natural power of two
  # (`2^1 -> 2`, `2^2 -> 4`, `2^3 -> 8`...). Cells are not considered squares. Therefore, the smallest possible square
  # (of size `2^1`) has cells for each of its four quadrants, while all larger squares (of size `2^n`) have squares of one smaller
  # size (`2^(n-1)`) for each of their four quadrants.
  #
  # For example, a square of size eight (`2^3`) is composed of four squares of size four (`2^2`):
  #
  #     nw         ne
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ————#————
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #     sw         se
  #
  # The squares of size four are in turn each composed of four squares of size two (`2^1`):
  #
  #     nw           ne
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       ——+——|——+——
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       —————#—————
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       ——+——|——+——
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #       ..|..|..|..
  #     sw           se
  #
  # And those in turn are each composed of four cells, which cannot be subdivided. (For simplicity, a Cafe au Life
  # board is represented as one such large square, although the HashLife
  # algorithm can be used to handle any board shape by tiling it with squares.)
  #
  # The key principle behind HashLife is taking advantage of redundancy. Therefore, two squares with the same alive and dead cells
  # are always represented by the same, immutable square objects. HashLife exploits repetition and redundancy by making all squares
  # idempotent and unique. In other words, if two squares contain the same sequence of cells, they are represented by the same
  # instance of class `Square`. For example, there is exactly one representation of a square of size two containing four empty cells:
  #
  #     nw  ne
  #       ..
  #       ..
  #     sw  sw
  #
  # And thus, a square of size four containing sixteen empty cells is represented as four references to the exact same square of
  # size two containing four empty cells:
  #
  #     nw     ne
  #       ..|..
  #       ..|..
  #       --+--
  #       ..|..
  #       ..|..
  #     sw     se
  #
  # And likewise a square of size eight containing sixty-four empty cells is represented as four references to the exact same
  # square of size four containing sixteen empty cells.
  #
  #     nw         ne
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ----+----
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #     sw         se
  #
  # Obviously, the same goes for any configuration of alive and dead cells: There is one unique representation for any possible
  # square and each of its four quadrants is a reference to a unique representation of a smaller square or cell.
  #
  # ### The Speed of Light
  #
  # In Life, the "Speed of Light" or "*c*" is one cell vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in any direction. Meaning,
  # that cause and effect cannot travel faster than *c*.
  #
  # One consequence of this fundamental limit is that given a square of size `2^n | n > 1` at time `t`, HashLife has all
  # the information it needs to calculate the alive and dead cells for the inner square of size `2^n - 2` at time `t+1`.
  # For example, if HashLife has this square at time `t`:
  #
  #     nw        ne
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ----+----
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #       ....|....
  #     sw        se
  #
  # HashLife can calculate this square at time `t+1`:
  #
  #     nw         ne
  #
  #        ...|...
  #        ...|...
  #        ...|...
  #        ---+---
  #        ...|...
  #        ...|...
  #        ...|...
  #
  #     sw         se
  #
  # And this square at time `t+2`:
  #
  #     nw         ne
  #
  #
  #         ..|..
  #         ..|..
  #         --+--
  #         ..|..
  #         ..|..
  #
  #
  #     sw         se
  #
  # And this square at time `t+3`:
  #
  #     nw        ne
  #
  #
  #
  #          ..
  #          ..
  #
  #
  #
  #     sw        se
  #
  #
  # This is because no matter what is in the cells surrounding our square, their effects cannot propagate
  # faster than the speed of light, one row inward from the edge every step in time.
  #
  # HashLife takes advantage of this by storing enough information to quickly look up the shrinking
  # 'future' for every square of size `2^n | n > 1`. The information is called a square's *result*.
  #
  # ## Computing the result for squares
  #
  # ![Block laying seed](block_laying_seed_2.png)
  #
  # *(Another small pattern that creates a block-laying switch engine, a "puffer train" that grows forever.)*
  #
  # Let's revisit the obvious: Cells do not have results. Also, Squares of size two do not have results,
  # because at time `t+1`, cells outside of the square will affect every cell in the square.
  #
  # The smallest square that computes a result is of size four (`2^2`). Its result is a square of
  # size two (`2^1`) representing the state of those cells at time `t+1`:
  #
  #     ....
  #     .++.
  #     .++.
  #     ....
  #
  # The computation of the four inner `+` cells from their adjacent eight cells is straightforward and
  # is calculated from the basic 2-3 rules or looked up from a table with 65K entries.

  # ## Recursively constructing squares of size eight (and larger)
  #
  # ![Lightweight Spaceship](LWSS.gif)
  #
  # *(A small pattern that moves.)*
  #
  # Now let's consider a square of size eight (or larger). For the moment, we can ignore the question of what happens
  # when a square is not in the cache, because when dealing with squares of size eight, we only ever need
  # to look up squares of size four, and they are all seeded in the cache. (Once we have established how
  # to construct the result for a square of size eight, including its result and velocity, we will be able
  # to write out `.find` method to handle looking up squares of size eight and dealing with cache 'misses'
  # by constructing a new square.)

  # Here's our class for recursively computible squares. We'll actually use this for all squares we build on the fly.
  class Square.RecursivelyComputable extends Square

    # We know how to obtain any square of size four using `cache.find`. So what we need is a way to compute
    # the result for any arbitrary square of size eight or larger from quadrant squares one level smaller.
    #
    #
    # Our goal is to compute a result that looks like this (the lines and crosses are part of the result):
    #
    #     nw        ne
    #
    #         +--+
    #         |..|
    #         |..|
    #         +--+
    #
    #     sw        se
    #
    # Given that we know the result for each of those four squares, we can start building an intermediate result.
    # The constructor for `IntermediateResult` takes a square and constructs the pieces of an intermediate square,
    # one that is half way between the level of the square and the level of the square's eventual result.
    #
    # We'll step through that process in the constructor piece by piece.
    #

    # ### Making an Intermediate Square from a Square

    # An intermediate square is half-way in size between a square of size 2^n and 2^(n-1). For a square of size
    # eight, its intermediate square would be size six. Instead of having four quadrants, intermediate squares have
    # nine components.
    #
    # For performace reasons, we don't check, however each component must be a square and not a cell. Thus, you cannot
    # make an intermediate square from a square of size four.
    #
    # One way to make an intermediate square is to chop a square up into overlapping
    # subsquares, and take the result of each subsquare. If the square is level `n`, and
    # the subsquares are level `n-1`, the intermediate square will be at time `T+2^(n-3)`.
    #
    # For example, a square of size eight (level 3) can be chopped into overlapping squares of size
    # four (level 2). Since the result of a square of size four is `T+2^0` in its future, the
    # intermediate square constructed from the results of squares of size four will be at time `T+1`
    # relative to the square of size eight.
    #
    # First, Let's look at our square of size eight made up of four component squares of size four (the lines
    # and crosses are part of the components):
    #
    #     nw        ne
    #       +--++--+
    #       |..||..|
    #       |..||..|
    #       +--++--+
    #       +--++--+
    #       |..||..|
    #       |..||..|
    #       +--++--+
    #     sw        se
    #
    # We can take the results of those four quadrants and add them to our intermediate square
    #
    #     nw        ne
    #
    #        nw..ne
    #        nw..ne
    #        ......
    #        ......
    #        sw..se
    #        sw..se
    #
    #     sw        se
    #
    # We will see below the exact mechanism for extracting the results, the important thing for the moment is
    # the idea that we have four squares 'built in' that we're going to use to get those results.
    #
    # We can also derive four overlapping squares, these representing `nn`, `ee`, `ss`, and `ww`:
    #
    #          nn
    #       ..+--+..        ..+--+..
    #       ..|..|..        ..|..|..
    #       +-|..|-+        +--++--+
    #       |.+--+.|      w |..||..| e
    #       |.+--+.|      w |..||..| e
    #       +-|..|-+        +--++--+
    #       ..|..|..        ..|..|..
    #       ..+--+..        ..+--+..
    #          ss
    #
    # Deriving these from our four component squares is straightforward, and when we take their results,
    # we fill in four of the five missing blanks for our intermediate square:
    #
    #     nw        ne
    #
    #        ..nn..
    #        ..nn..
    #        ww..ee
    #        ww..ee
    #        ..ss..
    #        ..ss..
    #
    #     sw        se
    #
    # We use a similar method to derive a center square:
    #
    #     nw        ne
    #
    #        ......
    #        .+--+.
    #        .|..|.
    #        .|..|.
    #        .+--+.
    #        ......
    #
    #     sw        se
    #
    # And we extract its result square accordingly:
    #
    #     nw        ne
    #
    #        ......
    #        ......
    #        ..cc..
    #        ..cc..
    #        ......
    #        ......
    #
    #     sw        se
    #
    # Given this basic pattern, let's see how we actually do it.

    # where `n` is the level of the square.
    #
    # The naïve result is obtained as follows: We construct an intermediate square from subresults (moving
    # forward to `T+2^(n-2)`), and then we obtain its overlapping squares and take *their* results (moving
    # forward `2^(n-2)` again, for a total advance of `2^(n-1)`).
    #
    # Of course, there's another refinement: Instead of naïvely writinga method, we take our mapping functions

    # whereas `sequence(f, g, h)(x)` -> `h(g(f(x)))`. That doesn't look like much, but a better way to put it is:
    #
    #   (x) ->
    #     _temp = f(x)

  # ## Computing the future of a square
  #
  # Let's say we have a square and we wish to determine its future at time `t`.
  # We calculate the smallest square that could possibly contain its future, taking
  # into account that the pattern in the square could grow one cell in each direction
  # per generation.
  #
  # We take our square and 'pad' it with empty squares until it is large enough to
  # contain its future. We then double that square and embed our pattern in the center. This becomes our base
  # square: It's our square embdedded in a possible vast empty square. We then take the
  # base square's `result_at_time(t)` which gives us the future of our pattern.
