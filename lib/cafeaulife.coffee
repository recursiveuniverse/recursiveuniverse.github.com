# # Cafe au Life

## What

# Cafe au Life is an implementation of John Conway's [Game of Life][life] cellular automata
# written in [CoffeeScript][cs]. Cafe au Life runs on [Node.js][node], it is not designed
# to run as an interactive program in a browser window.
#
# Cafe au Life's Github project is [here](https://github.com/recursiveuniverse/recursiveuniverse.github.io/).
#
# This file, [cafeaulife.coffee][source] contains the core engine for computing the future of any life universe
# of size `2^n | n > 1`. The algorithm is optimized for computing very large numbers of generations
#  of very large and complex life patterns with a high degree of regularity such as implementing
# Turing machines.
#
# As such, it is particularly poorly suited for animating displays a generation at a time. But it
# is still a beautiful algorithm that touches on the soul of life’s “physics."

#
# ### Conway's Life and other two-dimensional cellular automata
#
# The Life Universe is an infinite two-dimensional matrix of cells. Cells are indivisible and are in either of two states,
# commonly called "alive" and "dead." Time is represented as discrete quanta called either "ticks" or "generations."
# With each generation, a rule is applied to decide the state the cell will assume. The rules are decided simultaneously,
# and there are only two considerations: The current state of the cell, and the states of the cells in its
# [Moore Neighbourhood][moore], the eight cells adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
#
# Cafe au Life implements Conway's Game of Life, as well as other "[life-like][ll]" games in the same family.

#
# ## Why
#
# Cafe au Life is based on Bill Gosper's brilliant [HashLife][hl] algorithm. HashLife is usually implemented in C and optimized
# to run very long simulations with very large 'boards' stinking fast. The HashLife algorithm is, in a word,
# **a beautiful design**, one that is "in the book." To read its description is to feel the desire to explore it on a computer.
#
# Broadly speaking, HashLife has two major components. The first is a high level algorithm that is implementation independent.
# This algorithm exploits repetition and redundancy, aggressively 'caching' previously computed results for regions of the board.
# The second component is the cache itself, which is normally implemented cleverly in C to exploit memory and CPU efficiency
# in looking up precomputed results.
#
# Cafe au Life is an exercise in exploring the beauty of HashLife's recursive caching or results, while accepting that the
# performance in a JavaScript application will not be anything to write home about relative to hard core implementations. It's
# still incredible relative to brute force, which is a testimony of the importance of algorithms over implementations.

# Cafe au Life is divided into modules:
#
# * The [Universe Module][universe] introduces the `Cell` and `Square` classes that implement the [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree).
# * The [Future Module][future] provides methods for computing the future of a square in the [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree), making full use of recursion.
# * The [Canonicalization Module][canonicalization] implements a very naive hash-table for canoncial representations of squares. HashLife uses extensive
# [canonicalization][canonical] to optimize the storage of very large patterns with repetitive components. Without the cache, the
# space required to store a pattern would be larger in HashLife than in a naïve matrix.
# * The [Memoization Module][memoization] stores the results of computing the future of squares. Just as the Canonicalization Module
# compresses HashLife's space requirements through looking up precomputed squares, the Memoization Module compresses HashLife's execution
# time requirements by looking up precomputed results.
# * The [Garbage Collection Module][gc] implements a simple reference-counting garbage collector for the cache. For more information,
# read [Implementing Garbage Collection in CS/JS with Aspect-Oriented Programming][igc]
# * The [API Module][api] provides methods for grabbing json or strings of patterns and resizing them to fit expectations.
# * The [Menagerie Module][menagerie] provides a few well-know life objects predefined for you to play with. It is entirely optional.
#
# The modules will build up the functionality of our `Cell` and `Square` classes.

# ## The first time through
#
# If this is your first time through the code, start with the [universe][universe] module, and then read the [future][future] module
# to understand the core algorithm for computing the future of a pattern. You can look at the [canonicalization][canonicalization] and
# [memoization][memoization] modules next to understand how Cafe au Life runs so quickly. Review the [garbage collection][gc],
# [menagerie][menagerie], and [API][api] modules at your leisure, they are incidental to the core idea.

# ## Todo List
#
#
# TODO: Extract futures module so that it can run in naïve brute force mode without it. This means finding a way to generalize '.succ'.
#       With the future module removed, it should still use a [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree), but not cache results and notlook more than one generation into the future.
#       The [Quadtree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree) is then simply a space-saving measure.
#
# TODO: Support changing the rules during a run. The Canonicalization Module will have to clear the cache.
#
# TODO: Decouple canonicalization so that it can work with or without the Canonicalization Module. If the Canonicalization Module is removed, it should work VERY slowly.
